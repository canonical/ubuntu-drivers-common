  * gpu-manager.c:
    - Move away the xorg.conf if mesa is selected as a
      fallback and binary drivers are still in use in the
      xorg.conf. This will prevent X from failing when
      users on hybrid systems uninstall a binary driver.

    - Also remove the current upstart job from the architectures

    - Replace laptop specific hack to detect the need to offload
      rendering to the discrete card with code that opens the
      available drm devices and checks the connected outputs.
      If any outputs are connected to the Intel card, then we
      choose offloading. This also helps when the monitor is
      still connected to Intel on desktop systems with Intel +

      card is available (LP: #1126234). This is now possible

  * debian/control: Drop hard packagekit/aptdeamon dependencies, and move them
    to Suggests/Enhances. We do not need them for the core code, just for the
    PackageKit plugin.
  * UbuntuDrivers/PackageKit.py: Drop system_driver_packages(), as it is
    really not that useful: For UIs using the PackageKit API you cannot call
    it, and for Ubuntu specific UIs you can use the faster
    UbuntuDrivers.detect API. Instead, provide the functionality through the
    WhatProvides(HARDWARE_DRIVER, "drivers_for_attached_hardware") call, which
    is defined in PackageKit. Adjust tests accordingly.
  * debian/control: Update description.
  * debian/control: Drop obsolete XB-Python-Version.
  * debian/control: Move packagekit-backend-aptcc from Breaks to Conflicts, as
    it is unversioned.
  * UbuntuDrivers/PackageKit.py: Add pkcon example for HARDWARE_DRIVERS to
    header comment.
  * UbuntuDrivers/detect.py, packages_for_modalias(): Avoid returning the same
    package multiple times.
  * Add README: Document purpose, interfaces, and detection logic.
  * Add debian/ubuntu-drivers-common.apport: Apport hook to include the output
    of "ubutu-drivers debug". Add dh-apport build dependency and enable in
    debian/rules.
  * Add dh-modaliases, moved from the obsolete Jockey package:
    - Add debhelper/dh_modaliases: Debhelper program to produce a
      ${modaliases} substvar from scanning .ko files or
      debian/packagename.modaliases.
    - Add debhelper/modaliases.pm: dh_auto sequencer for dh_modaliases.
    - Add debian/dh-modaliases.install: Install above files.
    - debian/control: Add dh-modaliases package.
    - debian/rules: Create manpage from dh_modaliases POD.
  * Add debhelper/test_dh_modaliases: Old test script for dh_modaliases from
    Jockey. This is not integrated into "make check" and uses the
    snd_hda_intel kernel module from the system; this needs to be run manually
    for now.
  * debian/rules: Respect "nocheck" in $DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

  * tests/ubuntu_drivers.py: Add PluginsTest to check that shipped plugins

ubuntu-drivers-common (1:0.2.46) quantal; urgency=low

  * Rename to ubuntu-drivers-common, as this package is already necessary for
    fglrx as well, and will soon get support for more drivers (replacing
    Jockey). Update file references and names everywhere, and drop the
    obsolete debian/README.Debian and debian/nvidia-common.preinst.
  * debian/control: Fix for current python packaging policy (XS- → X-), and
    drop obsolete debian/pycompat.
  * debian/control: Add Vcs-* tags.
  * setup.py: Move from distutils to setuptools, to get an egg info (needed to
    provide PackageKit plugins). Add python-setuptools build dependency.
  * Add tests/fakesysfs.py: Provide a fake sysfs directory for testing.
    Adapted from upower's integration test suite.
  * Add tests/testarchive.py: Class for building an apt archive with test
    packages.
  * Add UbuntuDrivers/detect.py, tests/ubuntu_drivers.py: Hardware/driver
    detection functionality.  These are borrowed and streamlined from Jockey.
  * Add aptdaemon/PackageKit (apt backend) plugin for what-provides MODALIAS:
    - Add UbuntuDrivers/PackageKit.py: The actual plugin, which checks the
      query against the patterns packages specify in their "Modaliases:"
      header. Also provides a system_driver_packages() function to get all
      driver packages applicable for the system.
    - setup.py: Install the new UbuntuDrivers Python package and register the
      plugin entry point.
    - tests/ubuntu_drivers.py: Add tests cases for UbuntuDrivers.PackageKit,
      using a test aptdaemon instance on a local session bus.
    - debian/control: Add python-aptdaemon.pkcompat dependency. Also specify
      packagekit as an alternative, but conflict to packagekit-backend-aptcc
      for now, as this does not support the MODALIAS what-provides query, nor
      plugins. This means that you cannot currently install this package
      together with packagekit as long as the latter hard-depends on the aptcc
      backend. Also add aptdaemon/dbus build dependencies to be able to run
      the tests during build time.
  * tests/run: Exit with a nonzero code if there are failures or errors.
  * debian/rules: Ensure that our egg-info is built before running the tests,
    and removed again on clean.
  * debian/copyright: Rewrite using copyright 1.0 format.
  * Add ubuntu-drivers: Command line tool to list available driver packages
    for this system and auto-install them. This replaces the functionality of
    "jockey-text --auto-install". This does not use any D-BUS communication,
    so is safe to run in chroots.
  * debian/control: Switch to Architecture: any, we are already building this
    package anywhere but powerpc.
  * setup.py: Remove commented code for updating .mo files. This package is
    not supposed to show user-visible strings, and if we ever get them it
    should rather use python-distutils-extra.
  * setup.py: Only build hybrid-detect on x86 machines.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.
